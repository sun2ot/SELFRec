## Introduction

This is a forked implementation of the original [SELFRec](https://github.com/Coder-Yu/SELFRec) by Coder-Yu.

The main changes are:
- Support multi-modal datasets
- Use Large Language Models to enhance presentations
- Update some deprecated APIs
- Improve code readability by type hint and docstrings
- Refactor some modules

## Environment

The Python and package managers version are:
- Python 3.9.19
- mamba 1.5.8
- conda 24.3.0

Use conda/mamba to install the environment (Recommend):
```bash
mamba create -n selfrec python=3.9
mamba activate selfrec
```

Or use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `env.full.yml` is exported by `mamba env export`. Do not use this to build the environment, for reference only!
